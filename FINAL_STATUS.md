## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create backend/.env file
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/greenh2_credits
JWT_SECRET=greenh2-super-secret-jwt-key-2024
COOKIE_SECRET=greenh2-cookie-secret-key-2024

# Create frontend/.env file
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
REACT_APP_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=localhost
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=1337
REACT_APP_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
```

### 2. Start the System
```bash
# Option 1: Use startup scripts
./start-project.sh          # Mac/Linux
start-project.bat           # Windows

# Option 2: Manual start
cd backend && npm run dev   # Terminal 1
cd frontend && npm start    # Terminal 2
```

### 3. Test the System
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Register a new user account
3. Login and explore your role dashboard
4. Test credit request workflow

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: Backend won't start
**Solution**: Check MongoDB is running and .env file exists

### Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution**: Verify backend is running on port 4000 and CORS is configured

### Issue: Authentication errors
**Solution**: Check JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET in backend/.env

### Issue: Database connection fails
**Solution**: Start MongoDB service or check connection string
